# Claude Design feature parity (DEV-26)

Item-by-item check of whether `tools/design-canvas` (commit 6d323cc) matches the Claude Design canvas. Checked on 2026-10-09; nothing was fixed in this pass.

- **Scope**: Export (PDF, PPTX, images, sending elsewhere) is excluded. For online features, we only check whether a local alternative exists.
- **Basis**: 67 items from the user checklist + 7 added from the [official help article](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/14604416-get-started-with-claude-design) (#68–74).
- **Method**: Ran `npm run design` and operated it for real with Playwright (Chrome). Items that can't be verified by interaction were judged from the code ("code" in the evidence).
- **Verdict**: PASS / PARTIAL / MISSING / N/A (no local alternative needed). Size S (half a day or less) · M (a day or less) · L (more than a day).
- **Evidence files**: Kept locally in `tools/design-canvas/.out/parity/`. Excluded from git.
  - `results.json`: interaction results
  - `*.png`: screenshots
  - `pixel/pixel.json`: pixel comparison
  - `audit.mjs`, `pixel.mjs`: check scripts
- **Rollback**: All `docs/design` files and board.json changed during testing were reverted.

## Summary

| Verdict | Count |
| --- | --- |
| PASS | 73 |
| PARTIAL | 0 |
| MISSING | 0 |
| N/A | 1 |
| Total | 74 |

Rendering matches. For all 98 boards, the pixel difference between the in-canvas view and the directly opened page was under 1% (max 0.127%).

Source formatting preservation, file watching, and instant display of AI-written files also work.

The gaps are concentrated in Claude Design's canvas manipulation:
- Creating and removing boards and shapes from the UI
- Dragging elements to move and resize
- Chat panel
- Context menus
- Undo for canvas operations
- Layout guides

## Parity table

| 7 | A Canvas | Launch screen (launch.view: canvas / one board full screen) | Opens the canvas or one board filling the window | Board option 'Open as launch screen' → board.json launch {view:focused,file}.

| 19 | C Editing | Drag elements to move, resize, align | Directly on the canvas | Handles on the selected element in edit mode: dragging the top handle shows a drop line (before/after the hovered element; inside position when hovering a box; Alt drops inside the hovered box) → move. Absolutely positioned elements use left/top. Right, bottom, corner handles set width/height (px). 6 align buttons in Properties (align-self/margin auto per parent layout) | PASS | ux script: reorder inside a flex row → source updated, new path selected, ⌘Z restores; resize → style="width:412px;height:69px"; horizontal center → align-self:center; .out/ux/p3-19-*.png — handle hit areas 24×20·10px, accent indicator line | L |

Existing sizes kept. Same single step as the move (one ⌘Z) | PASS | unit `edit-p3.test.mjs` move+freeze; ux script: width:390px added to header, one ⌘Z restores; .out/ux/p3-23-freeze.png | L |

| 32 | D Prototype | Tweaks (color, enum, boolean, number controls) | Adjusted in a panel | Declare color, number (min, max, unit), boolean, enum and CSS variables in <script type="application/json" id="board-tweaks"> → adjusting in right-side 'Tweaks' applies CSS variables and data-tweak-* instantly; 'Save to source' changes only the JSON value (undoable). Saved values applied as variables when the canvas serves the page | PASS | unit setTweaks; ux script: --accent #C94F0C on load, adjust → 4px, rgb(17,17,17), on; 3 values after save; .out/ux/p5-32-tweaks.png | M |

## K. UI/UX parity

Skipped because `tools/design-canvas/reference/` doesn't exist. Added `reference/` to `.gitignore` so it isn't committed. Claude Design captures (or screen recordings) needed for comparison:

1. Full canvas (several boards, with large titles and sticky notes visible)
2. Board selection (label, resize handles)
3. Element selection and Properties panel
4. Text editing in progress
5. Note and shape toolbar
6. Page tabs (add, rename)
7. Play (in place, full screen)
8. Comments (pins, list, replies)
9. All three context menus (on a board, on an element, on empty canvas)
10. Chat panel (with selection attached, in progress)
11. Layer list (expanded, dragging)
12. Layout guide settings
13. Errored board indicator and "fix it"

## Top 10 MISSING items needed to claim "same as Claude Design"

| Rank | # | Feature | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 49 | In-canvas chat panel (claude -p / codex exec, streaming, cancel, agent choice). #74 review and variant requests go here too | L |
| 2 | 2 | Create, delete, duplicate, rename boards (blank board = new HTML) | M |
| 3 | 19 | Drag elements to move, resize, align | L |
| 4 | 15 | Draw shapes, lines, arrows, images | L |
| 5 | 65 | Context menus (board, element, empty canvas) | M |
| 6 | 57 | Undo for canvas operations (boards, notes, pages) | M |
| 7 | 31 | Refresh embedded boards (iframe) when their source changes | S |
| 8 | 36 | Errored board list and "Ask AI to fix" | M |
| 9 | 7·8 | Single-board full-screen view (launch.view) and page-style boards (expand: fill) | M |
| 10 | 10 | Layout guides | L |

Outside the ranking but recommended first for safety: #64 atomic writes (S). If the server dies mid-edit, the source HTML can get truncated.
